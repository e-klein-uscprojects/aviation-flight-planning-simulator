## Pilot Workflow Notes

I am a commercial and agricultural pilot with firsthand experience navigating aircraft across varied terrain, rapidly evolving weather systems, and controlled airspace. This file outlines the workflow logic I have practiced in the field and adapted here for simulation. The process has been simplified for clarity, but it retains the structure and reasoning used during active flight operations.

During agricultural missions, I routinely recalibrated routing based on prevailing wind conditions, fuel margins, field geometry, and local obstructions. Aircraft performance was often constrained by terrain, and flight windows had to be mapped with careful attention to wind gradients and localized gusting. The AgCat, in particular, demanded close coordination with ground crews during chemical applications and low-altitude pattern work.

In commercial settings, I worked with more advanced platforms—including the Citation CJ3—to support regional operations under IFR and VFR conditions. While the CJ3 offered generous range and cruise capabilities, departures were occasionally delayed due to low visibility ceilings and staggered sequencing under instrument clearance. Fuel optimization was no longer tactical—it became procedural. Pre-flight calculations included high-altitude fuel burn estimates, reserve margins, and alternate planning adjusted against live METAR and TAF updates.

Throughout both categories of flight, coordination with ATC was fundamental. Routing adjustments, unforecasted convective buildups, and emergency response planning were not hypothetical—they were operational realities. My decisions had to reflect both the technical limits of the airframe and the practical needs of safety, efficiency, and procedural compliance.

The simulation presented here is not an abstract exercise. It reflects, in structured logic, the kinds of decisions that define routine aviation. The ability to document that logic—across notebook workflows, dataset design, and contextual notes—has been instructive and purposeful. I believe this work mirrors the planning mindset I relied on in both agricultural and commercial operations.
