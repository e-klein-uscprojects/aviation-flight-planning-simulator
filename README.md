# Aviation Flight Planning Simulator

I am a commercial and agricultural pilot with nearly two decades of experience supporting flight operations across varied geographies, flight categories, and meteorological conditions. This repository presents a simulation of the workflow logic routinely applied during active pre-flight planning and in-flight operational adjustment. While the content has been simplified and adapted for demonstration, the structure reflects the clarity and discipline required to fly safely, efficiently, and professionally.

The opportunity to document this work in technical form has been both rewarding and instructive. I believe the logic and structure represented here mirror the judgment and procedures exercised daily by pilots in the fieldâ€”whether navigating remote agricultural routes, coordinating with ATC in congested airspace, or assessing fuel margins under shifting weather systems. 

I appreciate the utility of structured decision logic. I also value the chance to contribute meaningfully to the broader dialogue surrounding technical literacy and aviation analytics.

## Project Overview

A representative simulation of flight planning and operational workflow logic using Python and aviation data structure. Components include routing logic, fuel consumption modeling, weather interpretation, and airframe-based decision matrices. While simplified, each segment reflects the kind of logic adapted from real-world pilot experience.

## Repository Structure

- `planning/`: Simulated notebook for flight planning calculations  
- `data/`: Sample datasets for weather conditions and aircraft profiles  
- `docs/`: Operational notes and contextual summaries of pilot logic  

## Objective

To document the structure of flight preparation and operational modeling used in general aviation and aerial applications. This repository reflects the procedures and decision frameworks used during agricultural missions, commercial operations, and low-altitude route planning under variable weather constraints. It is a technical exercise grounded in applied experience.
